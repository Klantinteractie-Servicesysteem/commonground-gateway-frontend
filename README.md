# Common Ground Gateway GUI

The Common Ground Gateway GUI makes spinning up a Common Ground API interface easy.

Follow the installation instructions below and make sure the backend is connected.

The application is available in two versions, a Next.js version, and a Gatsby version. We recommend the Gatsby version
with deployment through Gatsby pages to deploy your prototype without setting up a server.

## Getting started

To set up your own project, you will need a GitHub account and be logged in. Simply click on the "use this template"
button. Tell GitHub where you want to spin up your prototype and click "create a repository from template".

## Spinning up your environment

You will need [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) (with [NPM](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v7/configuring-npm/install)) or [Yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/#windows-stable) installed on your machine for this part of the tutorial.

To develop locally, clone your new repository to your local machine. Open the terminal, navigate to the folder
containing your repository, and start up Gatsby or Next.js in development mode with the following commands.

**Nextjs**

```cli
$ cd /pwa
$ yarn install
$ yarn dev

```

**Gatsby**

```cli
$ npm install
$ npm run develop
```

After your dev environment has successfully set up your dev environment, navigate
to [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/) on Next.js or to [http://localhost:8000/](http://localhost:8000/)
for Gatsby.

## Publishing your prototype to the internet.

The Gatsby version of the application has built-in support for GitHub pages, meaning you can build your application into
a static website and publish it as a GitHub page. The repository comes with a built-in GitHub action for publishing
itself as a GitHub page. Your prototype will be automatically published to GitHub pages when pushed to the repository.

You need to activate GitHub pages on your repository for this deployment to work. Go to your repository's settings, go
to pages, select `gh-pages` as a source, and save (if you do not see a `gh-pages` branch, you can create one by pushing
to main).

After saving, wait for GitHub to publish your project and provide you with a link you can share for your demo. Keep in
mind that all pushes to main will result in updates to your online demo environment from this point on.

> Nextjs does not have the same support for hosting on GitHub pages as Gatsby, but if you are looking for the option, you can find more info [here](https://github.com/gregrickaby/nextjs-github-pages. Besides GitHub pages, the easier way to deploy Nextjs is probably through [Vercel](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment)
